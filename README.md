# Code Quiz

## My Task

Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app needs to run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS while running on Javascript. Parameters for this activity were that questions display after the user presses start; when answers are incorrect, the user loses time, and the game ends upon the completion of all questions of the user running out of time. The user has the option to save their name and score locally.
